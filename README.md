# Reverse-Arguments
An application that you can run along with arguments you want to reverse

# To use this application
<br>1. Download the zip or clone this github directory. <br>
<br>2. Inside the directory run the following in your terminal:
```
./Reverse <Words you want to reverse> <Return>
```
<br>If you are unable to run it then do the following inside this directory in your terminal:
```
gcc -o Reverse main.c
```
<br>This should have properly compiled main.c for your Linux/Unix distro as well as made Reverse an executable.<br>
