# WARNING!
This is highly experimental and might potential not even be at all that good.<br>
This is my first ever program I have written that takes in command line arguments and does something with it.<br>
If you encounter errors with this then it'll probably not be fixed since I just wanted to do this for fun and knowledge.<br>
